        <p>I have lived in Austin, TX for 12 years. Prior to that, I lived in Los Angeles, DC, and Philadelphia. I am currently
          a research affiliate in the Steve Hicks School of Social Work at the University of Texas at Austin and a licensed clinical psychologist 
          at Just Mind Counseling in Austin, TX. I received my Ph.D. in Clinical Psychology with a concentration in Clinical Child Psychology 
          from The George Washington University in Washington, DC. After about 25 years of a successful career as an advocate, activist, researcher, and therapist
          devoted to assisting survivors of interpersonal violence and trauma, I made the decision to shift gears and pursue a career in web development. I 
          am currently a student at the UT Austin Coding Bootcamp. I'm looking forward to discovering what this next phase of my life brings me!</p>
